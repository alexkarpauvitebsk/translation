    * What do I do? *

    Basically I clean common for telegram groups spam:
    - links to other telegram chats;
    - shortened links from new users;
    - links from suspicious members;
    - kick spammers;
    - trust real chat members.

    Aviable *group* commands:
    */start* actives bot;
    */status* show the current bot status;
    */stop* deactivates bot.

    Please follow my updates, new features will be available soon.
